This is our final year project which a non manual attendance system using face recognition.

We have used dlib for face detection and Microsoft cognitive face api for face recognition.

We have used our own phone camera to identify the faces and for test faces we have used our laptop camera.

1. The machine which we are using is windows 10 with Python 3.6 7
